In this repository you can find the code used for the Crypto supp website.

Crypto supp is a website which helps raise funds to develop projects that do not have the monetary amount they need to be created or continue developing, so on this page you can publish your project so that other people can donate Soles (solana coin) which will go directly to the fundraiser's wallet.
